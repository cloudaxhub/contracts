# Cloudax Smart Contracts

This project contains 9 different smart contract all tired to the Cloudax token.

Cloudax token implements the Cloudax token, a custom ERC20 token with added functionalities for managing a token sale and blacklisting addresses.

The rest of the contracts each having its description capture within the contract are vesting contracts, intended to facilitate token distribution processes, particularly those involving gradual release over time, which is common in token sales and employee compensation schemes.
